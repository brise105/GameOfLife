# GameOfLife


Program description: 
>this program runs the automation invented by John Conway called the Game of Life. the Game follows 3-4 simple rules, but it is able to produce complex patterns/shapes. This code approaches the game by creating 3 arrays: gameTable(original grid), currentArray (current grid), and nextArray (next grid). the first array is copied to the second. then the second and third arrays are copied, updated, then printed to a console/file.


Instructions: type "make" to compile the main.cpp and ConwaysGame.cpp and "./Driver.exe" to run!
